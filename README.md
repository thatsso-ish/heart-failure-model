The model basically predicts if a patient will die based on creatinine phosphokinase, ejection fraction, platelets, serum creatinine and serum sodium; which will lead to heart failure. I will integrate this model with SQL for storage and Tableau for visuals. Please credit me for any piece of work copying from this repository. I will also create a python module that will make it easier to work on new dataset using this model.

Let's continue building fellows.
