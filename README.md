The model basically predicts the total points a batsman will likely get by using the sixes, fours, minutes played, wickets, ball faced and running overs. I will integrate this model with SQL for storage and Tableau for visuals. Please credit me for any piece of work copying from this repository. I will also create a python module that will make it easier to work on new dataset using this model.

Let's continue building fellows.
